# Sudoku
 The all-time classic game that we all know and love: Sudoku.
 I have created a GUI using pygame that users can play Sudoku on and created a solver using backtracking.

 # Instructions
 Click a box and hit the number on your keyboard to pencil in a number. To confirm that value press the ENTER key on that box. To delete a pencil, you can click DEL. Finally, to solve the board,   press SPACE, sit back and watch the algorithm run.
